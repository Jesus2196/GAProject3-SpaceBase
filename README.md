#Into Infinity#
Created by Team AstroNuts—all of whom are avowed fans of space exploration—this app is made to assist anyone curious about the cosmos. With this app, you can catalog data on stars, planets, moons, and other objects in space, as well as the various missions sent to explore them.

##Getting Started##

[Into Infinity](http://intoinfinity.herokuapp.com "Into Infinity")
[Trello](https://trello.com/b/GESyISPn/space-objects "Trello")

1. A visitor to the site is free to browse the lists of celestial objects, and read a small card with data about some of the facts for each entry. These are divided by scale (stellar, system, satellite), and there is a separate section to read data about various space missions. The backgrounds shift to provide context for where the user is at any point during their visit to the site.

2. A user is created when a visitor signs up, providing their email and password. Logging in expands the menus, allowing a user to create entries and edit data. Further contextual background shifts occur in these areas as well. 

3. Users are also able to link planets to stars, and satellites to planets, as well as connect missions to any number of these items, to reflect single or multi-event space exploration missions.


##Next Steps##

1. Expand modeling scales, to allow for intragalactic- to galactic- to cosmic-structure- to universal-level entries.

2. Allow users to add a 'favorite' tag to a given object.

3. Allow users to be updated when data on a favorite item is changed.

4. Allow users to add comments and data on each model's index / general category.
